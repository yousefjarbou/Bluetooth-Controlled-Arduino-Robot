# Programming a Bluetooth-controlled Fire Fighter Arduino robot Sep 2022

This project focuses on developing a Bluetooth-controlled fire-fighting robot using Arduino.

The robot's primary objective is to collect ping pong balls and deposit them into multi-angle tubes, simulating filling up emergency water tanks. 

Utilizing an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and an HC-06 Bluetooth module to control the robot remotely via Bluetooth. 

The hardware includes a drive train system with four motors, a two-axis arm with a servo, and additional components like a digital screen to display voltage levels.

The code features motor control functions designed to protect the H-bridge from high currents by gradually accelerating to the required speed.
